# AI-Map-Solver
AI that will try to solve premade maps in the least amount of steps possible using various methods

The AI is told to solve one of (currently) 3 different maps, and will use several different methods to solve them in various different ways.
It is possible to adjust the "weight" of each of the solution methods in order to change how the level will be approached.

One goal is to allow the AI to adjust the weights as it goes so it can move towards the ideal soution for each map. Unsure if genetic algorithm or simulated annealing would be ideal.
